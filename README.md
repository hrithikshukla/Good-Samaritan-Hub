# Our React App: The Good Samaritan Hub

The Good Samaritan Hub is a web app built using MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js (MERN) that enables volunteers and voluntees to find each other. People are able to sign up, make posts (requests for help/offers to help), and chat with other members. Made as part of group project along with Jeremy Hsu, Ashley Lu, and Irina Li.

## Instructions to Run (If needed)

Start a local Mongo database:

```
mkdir mongo-data
mongod --dbpath mongo-data
```

Clone the github repository by running the following:  
`git clone https://github.com/hrithikshukla/Good-Samaritan-Hub.git`

Then navigate to `/Good-Samaritan-Hub/` and run the following:   
`cd client && npm install && npm run build && cd ../server && npm install && npm start`

Now open up your browser and go to `localhost:5000`

To load sample data in to MongoDB:
```
mongoimport  --drop --jsonArray --maintainInsertionOrder --uri="mongodb://localhost:27017"  --db="GoodSamaritanHub" --collection="admins" --file=".\sample_data\GoodSamaritanHub.admins.json"
mongoimport  --drop --jsonArray --maintainInsertionOrder --uri="mongodb://localhost:27017"  --db="GoodSamaritanHub" --collection="locations" --file=".\sample_data\GoodSamaritanHub.locations.json"
mongoimport  --drop --jsonArray --maintainInsertionOrder --uri="mongodb://localhost:27017"  --db="GoodSamaritanHub" --collection="messages" --file=".\sample_data\GoodSamaritanHub.messages.json"
mongoimport  --drop --jsonArray --maintainInsertionOrder --uri="mongodb://localhost:27017"  --db="GoodSamaritanHub" --collection="posts" --file=".\sample_data\GoodSamaritanHub.posts.json"
mongoimport  --drop --jsonArray --maintainInsertionOrder --uri="mongodb://localhost:27017"  --db="GoodSamaritanHub" --collection="users" --file=".\sample_data\GoodSamaritanHub.users.json"
```
All username passwords are `password` for the sample data


## Instructions to Use
### User
#### Login Credentials (on Heroku)
username: `user`  
password: `user`

#### Features:

- The landing page (`/`) explains to newcomers what the site is about. Its header contains a link back to the landing page and a link to the login page.
- On the login page (`/login`), the user can input their username and password, and log in. Banned users are blocked from logging in. If the user doesn’t have an account, they can click "Need to register?" (`/registration`) and create an account. For newly registered users, their username must not already exist and their password must be at least 8 characters.
- After logging in, the user is taken to the homepage (`/home`) where they can see a list of current posts in their own location (i.e. the location in their profile), filter these posts by offer/request, restrict the posts to a different location, create a new post, and search for users/posts by username, first and/or last name, and post title. At the top is a link to the homepage, a search box, a link to the user’s inbox, a link to the user’s profile page, and a logout button.
    - Clicking a post’s arrow button will expand the post, and you can read the full description of the post, go back, or click on the poster’s name to view their profile. 
        - If it’s your own post, you can also remove the post. Posts that you remove become permanently hidden from the public and are viewable only by you on your profile.
        - If it’s another person's post, you can also report the post or send the poster a message. Posts that you report become permanently hidden from you. 
    - Creating a new post will take you to a screen where you can input the title, body, type of request, and location and post it.
    - In search, if there are more than 6 users that match the search term (e.g. "user"), only 6 users are shown initially. You can click the arrow to show (at most) 6 more.
- On the Inbox page (`/inbox`), you can see all of your past messages and can message another user about their post. You can also report another person’s message. The header of each conversation with a user shows the latest request/offer involved (if any) as well as their location and a link to their profile page.
- The profile page (`/profile`) allows you to see a user’s info along with any posts they have made. 
    - If it’s your own profile, you also have the option to edit your info. 
    - If it’s another person’s profile, you can click Message to message them, which will bring up the past messages you have with this person or start a new conversation with them.
- The setting page (`/setting`) allows you to edit your profile information (first name, last name, biography, and location) and password.
    - Your first name, last name, and location must not be empty.
    - When changing your password but you must know your current password for safety reasons and must confirm the new password you entered to prevent typing mistakes. Your new password must be at least 8 characters.



### Admin

#### Login Instructions and Credentials:
The admin login page can be found at `/adminLogin`

username: `admin`  
password: `admin`  

#### Features:
- After logging in the admin can see a list of all the users. The list is sorted with those having a report pending at the top to allow the admin to easily see them. 
- Clicking a user shows their complete information and post history, as well as any reports other users have made about them. The admin can look at the reports and either delete the report or ban the user with a ban reason. 
- The admin can also unban a previously banned user.
